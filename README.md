# BP3 Coding challenge

A CommonJS implementation of the BP3 task query functions.

# System Requirements
- nodejs (I used V4.1.0 but any version should work)

# Structure
test.js demonstrates my understanding of the expected behavior of the queries. It also documents the nature of the two test data sources: task.json and rosie_tasks.json. See the test functions for examples of how to invoke the queries.

challenge.js contains the query API. To load it:

	challenge=require('./challenge.js')

See challenge.js for details on the exported API.
